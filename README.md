Weather Dashboard
Description
This project is a weather dashboard that leverages the OpenWeather API to provide users with a 5-day forecast and search history for various cities. When a user searches for a city, the app converts the city name to geographical coordinates to retrieve weather information. Through this project, I gained experience in generating and securely managing API keys, setting up environment variables using the dotenv package, and constructing API calls based on documentation.
